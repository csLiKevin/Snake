    - The scale doesn't divide evenly into dimensions.
2. Use images to represent the snake and the apple.
3. Show a counter that keeps track of the snake length.
4. Optimize the function for getting a random available coordinate.
5. Add the ability to pause.
6. Animate the snake movement more smoothly.
